## Self-Reflection

- **How long it took me to finish this?**
<!-- Answer below this line -->
- It took me about 3-4 days to finish this assignment. I really didn't want to use the code from previous assignments to test my understanding levels and see if i could build it from scracth again.

- **What do you think of this completion time?**
<!-- Answer below this line -->
- I think it could've been done way sooner, but I tend to procrastinate alot. Maybe if I locked in, I could've gotten it done within a day or two.

- **In hindsight, what would you do differently?**
- <!-- Answer below this line -->
- I would start earlier and get the work out of the way instead of trying to finish everything on the day that it is due. I also thought about making a battleship game so it could be fun to play, but I got the idea last minute so it was already too late.

- **What resources did you use?**
- <!-- Answer below this line -->
-  I used ChatGPT and W3schools and I used ChatGPT by giving it all the inputs I wanted in terms of minimalism and simple design for the game hub. To be honest, it did a horrible job compared to what I actually expected but it was really cool to just give something ideas and watch it bring it to life or atleast close to it.

**REFLECTION**
- I am really happy with the way it turned out and I am genuinely so obsessed with the idea of bringing a vision to life. It was really cool to understand every aspect of a game, and somehow integrate with multiplayer in a way that someone else can use a room code I generated to play a game that I created. To me, that's pretty cool. I learned that coding is not so boring after all. I had a hard time trying to understand everything and break topics down into parts and try to learn the base code of whatever lamguage we were using. I realized it was more fun after we could do whatever and customize it for games, because then it doesn't even feel like I am learning something, I just feel like I am zoned out into creating something cool. Peer feedback helped me understand that people are so talented. The peer I reviewed had an absolutely professional and minimalistic looking website that I have no idea how to create. He amd his teammate did an amazing job and it inspired me to step my game up too. 

Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed the class and learned alot unintentionally. It was fun to mess around with code that makes games and its aspects.
